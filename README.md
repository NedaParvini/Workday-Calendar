How to Code:

First, I created a repository and then clone it to my device.
Then I wrote codes in html for different time blocks and define them as separated <div>s 
I got them some Bootstrap styles.
I also define <script> so I assigned js external file
In JS file first I define saveBtn as a variable and then I write a code to show current day in top of the page
Then I wrote function for each block to show when we are in the past, present or future based on different color codes.
Each time I write a task in the planner and I push the save button it goes to local storage and save there, so when I refresh the page, I can see them.
I call the functions at then end of the file.
